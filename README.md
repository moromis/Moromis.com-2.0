# Moromis.com-2.0

## This is the Github for the my personal project site, hosted at [moromis.com](http://moromis.com)

This project is written in Javascript and HTML (of course). It's an Express app on the backend, on top of NodeJS. On the front end, it's EJS template/partial pages and styling done through Bootstrap 4.0.
